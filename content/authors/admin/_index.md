Welcome to my website! I am a second year PhD student in Finance at [Columbia Business School](https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/cbs-directory/phd/NKoont23). I want to understand how financial stability is affected by globalization and recent trends in financial intermediation. I am also interested in the interplay between finance and political economy. 

I'm originally from the Washington D.C. area. In 2018 I graduated from the University of Toronto withÂ a BSc in math and economics, and a newfound appreciation for Canada. I enjoy trying to make sense of the world.
